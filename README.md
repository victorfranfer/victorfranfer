### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Victor Francisco Ferreira and I have been learning a lot about web development recently! 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on studying a lot and getting my first job experience in technology. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Node.JS, Sequelize, MongoDB, MySQL, TypeScript, Javascript, HTML, CSS.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: victorfranciscoferreira@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've had experiences working in journalism and education, teaching foreign languages in private and public schools. I've also led a team of teachers during the pandemic, transitioning operations from all face-to-face classes to remote classes. That was challenging!
