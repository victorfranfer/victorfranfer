- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: victorfranciscoferreira@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've had experiences working in journalism and education, teaching foreign languages in private and public schools. I've also led a team of teachers during the pandemic, transitioning operations from all face-to-face classes to remote classes. That was challenging!
